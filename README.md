# How to make any change

There are a few basic steps that will be common to any website change:

1. Create a branch
2. Make the changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Get comments or feedback from other organizers
5. Make further changes/commits as appropriate
5. Merge the branch

A more detailed description of that process can be found in the [Understanding the GitHub Flow Guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Small changes

For small changes (such as updating this README.md), the whole thing can be done on github.com without leaving the browser:

1. Browse to the file
2. Click the pencil icon to edit the file and make your changes
3. In the 'Commit changes box' add [an appropriate title and description](https://github.com/blog/926-shiny-new-commit-styles).
4. *IMPORTANT*: Be sure to select the option "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
5. Click "Propose file change".
