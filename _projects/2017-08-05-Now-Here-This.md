Find music artists at the location where you are at that moment on the road. Still currently in development. This app is to help artists find other artists based on locality and build a playlist. A different approach to music discovery, unlike Discover Weekly or Fresh Finds (this app is location-based). 

The technologies used in this project include: 
Spotify API (still working on it) - need artist's origin or location .
