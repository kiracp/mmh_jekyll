MusED stands for Music Education, Music Experience Design, and musing about Music.

On August 5, 2017 we held the [MusED Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _events/2017-08-05.md %}). The hackathon revolved around Music Education, Music Experience Design, and generally, musing about Music. It was held in collaboration with the [IMPACT Conference](https://impact.musedlab.org/) and NYU Steinhardt's [MusEDLab](https://musedlab.org/) lab.

After a set of invigorating talks and a pizza break, participants took part in workshops or gathered in groups and created hacks.

At 8, hacking ended. Many participants presented their work from the day. To view the final presentations, watch the twitter video below. Projects related to the theme are displayed on the [event page]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _events/2017-08-05.md %}) and under [projects]({{site.baseurl}}{% link projects.md %}).

We thank all the participants, speakers, volunteers, and our co-sponsors for helping make this a wonderful event.
